# Vaccine-API
A vaccine to give descriptions and recommendations for vaccines. Built with the MERN stack it has a demo project created with react on the front end which shows how you can use the api that we have created.

## Run
Use `npm start`
This will both compile the react and install all dependencies. It will then boot the express server which will serve the compiled react on the `/` default route. You also have the `/country` and `/vaccine` routes which will give you the coutries and vaccines.
